## Lightshot Screenshot Downloader

This Dart script is designed to automate the process of downloading screenshots from Lightshot, a popular screenshot sharing platform. It utilizes the `lightshot_parser` package to simplify the retrieval of screenshots based on user-defined parameters.

### How to Use

Use the parse method of the LightshotParser instance to start the process.
    numOfPhotos: Specify the number of screenshots you want to download.
    newAddresses: Set this flag to true if you want to parse new addresses with 12 characters instead of the default 6. New addresses parsing is very slow.
    startingUrl: Define the starting URL for parsing. If omitted, the script will use a random URL generator, otherwise uses contractor Url
